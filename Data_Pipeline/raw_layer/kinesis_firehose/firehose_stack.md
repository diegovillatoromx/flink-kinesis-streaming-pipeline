# Code Explanation

The following code is an AWS CDK (Amazon Web Services Cloud Development Kit) script used to configure and deploy AWS resources, specifically related to Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Kinesis Firehose.

```python
from aws_cdk import Stack, aws_kinesis as kinesis, aws_kinesisfirehose as firehose, aws_s3 as s3, Duration
from constructs import Construct
from decouple import config
```

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries and modules, including AWS CDK for defining AWS resources, and `decouple` for managing environment variables.

```
# Get environment variables
INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME = config("INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME")
RAW_DATA_BUCKET_NAME = config("RAW_DATA_BUCKET_NAME")
AWS_REGION = config("AWS_REGION")
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID = config("AWS_ACCOUNT_ID")  # New environment variable for account ID
``` 

Next, the code defines variables that store important values from environment variables. These variables include the Kinesis stream name, S3 bucket name, AWS region, and AWS account ID.


```
class DataTransferStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # Get the S3 bucket from the environment
        raw_data_bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "RawDataBucket", RAW_DATA_BUCKET_NAME)

````

The code defines a class named `DataTransferStack`, which inherits from `Stack`. In the constructor of this class, an S3 bucket resource is created using the bucket name defined in the `RAW_DATA_BUCKET_NAME environment variable.

```
        # Create a Kinesis stream from the ARN of the existing stream
        intraday_stream_arn = f"arn:aws:kinesis:{AWS_REGION}:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:stream/{INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME}"
        intraday_stream = kinesis.Stream.from_stream_arn(
            self, "IntradayKinesisStream", intraday_stream_arn
        )
```

Next, the ARN of the Kinesis stream is constructed using the `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME` environment variables. Subsequently, a Kinesis stream is created using the defined ARN.

```
        # Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that writes data to the S3 bucket
        delivery_stream = firehose.DeliveryStream(
            self, id="DeliveryStream",
            stream_name=INTRADAY_STREAM_NAME,
            source_kinesis_stream=intraday_stream,
            s3_destination_configuration=firehose.S3DestinationConfiguration(
                bucket=raw_data_bucket,
                prefix="firehose-data",
            ),
        )
```

Finally, a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream is created, connecting it to the Kinesis stream and writing data to the S3 bucket. This enables data transfer and storage from the Kinesis stream to the S3 bucket.

This code is used to automate the configuration of AWS resources, leveraging environment variables to flexibly configure and customize resources based on the application's needs.

Please ensure that the appropriate environment variables with the correct values are set before running the application.
